# Java2 Reflections

## Intro
I really enjoyed this unit. It was mainly a refresh of the entire java 1 class.
The refresher was nice after being away from the language for a summer.
However, it seemed a lot simpler for the larger programs than it had in java 1.
I am hoping it was due to the fact that it is all something that I have already done.
This first assignment was creating an object/class, this upcoming one seems like it may be
a slight challenge. 

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
Over the past week we have focused on creating tests for our software. The way we did this 
was through a test class, that instantiated an object, and then would test the returns of all the 
public methods within said objects class. What this will allow us to do is make it easier to 
test specific methods in our code to check if when all goes well that we get what is expected,
or when a exception is thrown we get what we expected.
