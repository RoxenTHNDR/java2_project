# Java2 Reflections

## Intro
I really enjoyed this unit. It was mainly a refresh of the entire java 1 class.
The refresher was nice after being away from the language for a summer.
However, it seemed a lot simpler for the larger programs than it had in java 1.
I am hoping it was due to the fact that it is all something that I have already done.
This first assignment was creating an object/class, this upcoming one seems like it may be
a slight challenge. 

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
Over the past week we have focused on creating tests for our software. The way we did this 
was through a test class, that instantiated an object, and then would test the returns of all the 
public methods within said objects class. What this will allow us to do is make it easier to 
test specific methods in our code to check if when all goes well that we get what is expected,
or when a exception is thrown we get what we expected.

## Collections
This week we were mainly focusing on Collections. This mainly was a recap of some matieral we had done in
the previous JAVA course. However it also added Sets and Maps. One of the excersises I found interesting
was taking an array list and making it so there was only one of each item within it. To do this in a very
simple manner, all we had to do was convert the list into a set and then back again, because a set only can
contain one of each element. Ex: List [1,1,2,2,3,3] -> Set [1,2,3] -> List [1,2,3]. I also found maps interesting
as they ran similar to a database table in that each entery has a key that it can be found by.

## Contributing to Open Source Projects
We had started our contributions to Hacktoberfest this week. Being a open source project for the entire class
over the month of October. I found this actually a bit challenging. Over the summer I had participated in up keep
and Updating a Discord Bot. However, we had basically done a shared repository (so merge-conflicts were a common
occurance. At the point of writing this I am planning on getting help from Marc on posting my assignments to the open
sourse repository.
