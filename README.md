# Java2 Reflections

## Intro
I really enjoyed this unit. It was mainly a refresh of the entire java 1 class.
The refresher was nice after being away from the language for a summer.
However, it seemed a lot simpler for the larger programs than it had in java 1.
I am hoping it was due to the fact that it is all something that I have already done.
This first assignment was creating a object/class, this upcoming one seems like it may be
a slight challenge.
